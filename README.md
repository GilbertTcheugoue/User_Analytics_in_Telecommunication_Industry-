# User_Analytics_in_Telecommunication_Industry

# Project understanding

The project aims to provide a report to analyse opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  We will do this by analysing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network and deliver insights we  managed to extract to the employer through an easy to use web based dashboard and a written report.
The project must  have:
●	Reusable code for data preparation and cleaning.
●	Code connected using scikit pipeline or other form of chaining multiple EDA steps  
●	Beautiful and insightful Streamlit dashboard that shows our findings.
●	SQL database as feature store which can be used to store selected features for dashboard visualisation and model training.
●	Your project folder should mirror as close as possible the following:
○	Code is installable via pip
○	Has unit tests with good test coverage
○	Has CI/CD setup - using Github Actions
○	Has Dockerfile to build it as docker image

The global objective is divided into 4 sub-objectives 
●	User Overview analysis
